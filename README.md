# Hospital-LOS-Prediction
A hospital has been incurring a lot of losses in revenue and life due to its inefficient management system. They have been unsuccessful in allocating pieces of equipment, beds, and hospital staff fairly. A system that could estimate the length of stay (LOS) of a patient can solve this problem to a great extent.

# Objective
Find out what factors affect the LOS the most, and come up with a machine learning model which can predict the LOS of a patient, using the data available during admission and after running a few tests. 

# Data
The data contains various information recorded during the time of admission of the patient. It only contains records of patients who were admitted to the hospital. The detailed data dictionary is given below:<br>

<li>patientid: Patient ID
<li>Age: Range of age of the patient<br>
<li>gender: Gender of the patient<br>
<li>Type of Admission: Trauma, emergency, or urgent<br>
<li>Severity of Illness: Extreme, moderate, or minor<br>
<li>health_conditions: Any previous health conditions suffered by the patient<br>
<li>Visitors with Patient: The number of patients who accompany the patient<br>
<li>Insurance: Does the patient have health insurance or not?<br>
<li>Admission_Deposit: The deposit paid by the patient during the admission<br>
<li>Stay (in days): The number of days that the patient has stayed in the hospital. This is the target variable<br>
<li>Available Extra Rooms in Hospital: The number of rooms available during the admission<br>
<li>Department: The department which will be treating the patient<br>
<li>Ward_Facility_Code: The code of the ward facility in which the patient will be admitted<br>
<li>doctor_name: The doctor who will be treating the patient<br>
<li>staff_available: The number of staff who are not occupied at the moment in the ward<br>
